# 4.0 Software Development Plan

## 4.1 Plan Introduction

This Software Development Plan provides the details of the planned development for the GRNsight version 3.0.0. which provides a web application and service for users to upload, view, and edit graphs of gene regulatory networks.

Existing applications that perform similar tasks are difficult to use for small GRNs with only a few genes represented, and often have very high learning curves. Additionally, they may require standalone download that may not be compatible with every userâ€™s computer. GRNsight aims to provide users with a simple, clean, and easy to use application for visualizing small- to medium-scale gene regulatory networks.

As a part of development, a series of deliverables will be created. 

* Project Proposal Presentations and Project Proposal Paragraph Document was submitted January 22nd 2018.
* Requirements Document was submitted February 5th 2018.
* Software Development Plan will be submitted by March 5th 2018.
* Software Development Plan resubmit will be submitted by March 19th 2018.
* Requirements Document resubmit will be submitted by April 2nd 2018.
* Preliminary Version of Poster will be submitted by April 9th 2018.
* Final Presentation / Demonstration will be April 30th 2018.

## 4.3 Project Organization / Human Resources

This section contains the information on the project organization. GRNsight is a team project currently comprised of 3 undergraduates: Eileen Choe (Computer Science), Jen Shin (Computer Science), and Mihir Samdarshi (Biology), and 2 faculty advisors: Dr. John Dionisio (Computer Science) and Dr. Kam Dahlquist (Biology).

For the CMSI402 Senior Project, Eileen and Jen will be completing four majors feature additions to GRNsight. The table below outlines the project member responsible for each feature: 

| Task                              | Developer |
| --------------------------------- | --------- |
| Updated GRNmap Spreadsheet Parser | Eileen    |
| Node Coloring Framework           | Eileen    |
| Block Layout                      | Jen       |
| Alternative Layouts               | Jen       |

### 4.3.1 Updated GRNmap Spreadsheet Parser

GRNsight is designed to accept Excel workbooks from GRNmap, a MATLAB GRN modeling program, and lay out the network graph specified by an adjacency matrix contained within one of the worksheets. However, the GRNmap output contains additional worksheets which store data about the GRN and results of the GRNmap simulations that have not been displayed or visualized by GRNsight. To address this, the Excel spreadsheet importer will be redesigned to parse and store data from the entire GRNmap output workbook in a standardized JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data structure. The complete data extraction from the GRNsight output includes experimental and simulated temporal expression data for each gene in the network.

1. Investigate current spreadsheet controller
2. Research the GRNmap input and output workbook formatting standards
3. Design a data model and implement a parser for GRNmap "expression" type sheets
4. Design a data model and implement a parser for GRNmap "2 column" type sheets
5. Design a data model and implement a parser for GRNmap "meta data" type sheets
6. Write unit tests to ensure software quality



### 4.3.2 Node Coloring Framework

A coloring framework will be developed to visualize expression data in the form of a stacked heat map overlay of the nodes which compares the experimental and simulated gene expression levels. Node coloring allows GRNsight users to better derive insights from the data that model these networks.

1. Perform user interviews to better understand use cases for node coloring
2. Decide on a color scheme that is color-blind friendly
3. Review D3 visualization library and complete relevant tutorials
4. Create a first draft of the node coloring framework
5. Develop UI menu for node coloring customization
6. Integrate user feedback for final draft of node coloring framework
7. Write unit tests to ensure software quality



### 4.3.3 Block Layout

The block layout alphabetically organizes the nodes in a grid pattern. Users can use a button to apply the layout to the graph and the nodes will be organized alphabetically left to right, then top to bottom. This will make it easier and faster for the users to analyze the data. 

The main developing goals to implement block layout includes:

1. Grid layout button
2. Applying d3-v4 grid layout.
3. Including webpack in order to use webpack to import.
4. Viewport size adaptive grid layout
5. Alphabetizing the nodes.
6. Centering the grid layout graph
7. Toggle to disable/enable force graph with the grid layout button



### 4.3.4 Alternate Layouts

Once the block layout is finished, alternate layouts will be developed in addition. Currently hierarchical layout and snap to grid feature are highest priority to implement next. The alternate graph layout provides the users an option to organize the nodes on the graph.

If time allows:

1. hierarchical layout
2. snap to grid feature
