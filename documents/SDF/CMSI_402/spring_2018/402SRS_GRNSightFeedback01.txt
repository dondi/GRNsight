GRNSight Project SRS Evaluation
===============================

Nice job on this, a very good document.

Just a couple of suggestions.

When thinking of requirements, try to be even more specific about what 
you are specifying.  For example, in requirement 5.2.2.1.7, what do you
mean by "move in the normal way afterward"?  What is the "normal" way?
"Afterward" meaning after what, exactly?

These are "philosophy of requirements" issues that you can apply in a
*general* way to nearly all the requirements in the document.  However,
in the essence of time remaining, I'm assigning full credit to this
deliverable, for both the initial and the final submissions.

Be sure to check your spelling...  "examen" in the paragraph for section
5.2.2 for example...

You don't have to do anything further with this document if you don't
feel the need to do so.

Deliverable D-02: 15% out of 15% = 100% which is an A-plus
Deliverable D-05:  5% out of  5% = 100% which is an A-plus

Keep up the good work!
